Competitive Analysis: Sales analysis can involve comparing sales performance with competitors to gauge market share and competitiveness. This information helps businesses strategize to stay ahead in the market.

Performance Metrics: Key performance indicators (KPIs) are used to measure sales performance, such as total revenue, average transaction value, conversion rate, customer acquisition cost, customer retention rate, and sales growth rate.

Visualization: Visualizing sales data through charts, graphs, and dashboards helps in presenting complex information in a more understandable and actionable format.

Continuous Improvement: Sales analysis is an iterative process. Regularly analyzing sales data allows businesses to track progress, identify areas for improvement, and implement changes to optimize sales performance over time.
